## Introduction
Welcome to the Calculator App, a Python program designed to perform various arithmetic operations based on user input. This application was developed as part of a project for the Andy superstore.

## Features

The Calculator App provides the following features:


Addition: Take multiple integer values entered by the user, add them, and print out the result.

Subtraction: Take multiple integer values entered by the user, perform subtraction in the order they are entered, and print out the result.

Multiplication: Take multiple integer values entered by the user, multiply them, and print out the result.

Division: Take two integer values entered by the user, divide the first number by the second, and print out the result. It accounts for the division by zero error.

Average: Take multiple integer values entered by the user and compute their average.

## Note
This program is designed to handle various arithmetic operations within a single application, offering a versatile and user-friendly experience.

It has error handling mechanisms, such as preventing division by zero and handling invalid inputs.

Feel free to explore the different operations and functionalities provided by the Calculator App.
